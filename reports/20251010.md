# Weekly Report - 2025-10-10

#### Last Week's Team Goals

- Figure out UI after pooling ideas from lo fi prototypes (1 week)
- Build up frontend components for main UI (2 weeks)
- Populate DB with relevant data for the project (2 weeks)

#### What We Did

- Choose which lo-fi to follow to build up our High Fidelity Prototype
- Divide the tasks to better organize the workflow
- Set up env and auth
- Finished up db connection and variables

#### What Worked

- Peer programming to learn and get work done
- Start working on the High Fidelity for the P5
- Clean up tasks on git
- Got the hands on coding to build up for more complex implementations

#### Where We Had Trouble

- Setting up a meeting time was challenging this week too
- Need to clarify some tasks
- Fail on understanding the lo-fi requirement (that everyone should make the same)

#### Where We Are Stuck

- Communication impacted on the deliver os some tasks
- Some tasks were still blocke by others

#### What We Learned

- Coding together makes the job easier
- We can always ask for help from the teammates
- It is important to have a weekly meeting to set up expectations

#### Team Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Start coding the UI and apply the High fidelity model
- Add more front end aspects to the page (just bones right now)
- Start coding on the screen syncronization and audio
- Create the Home page and course list

#### Monday Meeting Agenda

- Discuss the high fidelity model and see if it needs any changes
- Set up the planning for the read week
- Organize the next steps and set up the timelines

## Individual Reporting

### Matthew

#### Last Week's Goals

- Define better timelines for everyone’s tasks: we need a lot more structure
  regarding the actual execution of the project, and a team meeting where we has
  out who’s doing what by when is critical.
- I’d love to get some sort of code editor state integration working (if that’s
  still assigned to me by the time we finish the above point)

#### What I Did

- Ran a few peer programming sessions with Augusto and Ezzi, specifically
  working on Authentication and Database set up.
- Helped define more backlog items
- Got caught up on some missed class time

#### What Worked

- Adding documentation files to pull requests seems really valuable
- Peer programming sessions _seem_ to be valuable, more on that below

#### Where I had trouble

- Scheduling should be a permanent staple in this category, as we once again had
  a few meetings cancelled, postponed, or just late.
- It's hard for me to know if my pair programming sessions are valuable. Either
  I'm such a good teacher that no one has questions, or we're gonna have some
  knowledge debt to resolve later down the line.

#### Where I was stuck

- Didn't make a ton of headway in terms of task allocation: my week was mostly
  spent helping remove some blockers, so next week I'm hoping to pick up some
  new tasks and chip away independently

#### What I learned

- Nothing really new from me this week, felt more like review than new
  knowledge. Excited for next week to pick up something new!

#### Plans and Goals for Next Week

- Clean up the UI of the app (currently the home page is a kitchen sink)
- Run a few more pair programming sessions
- Get some more ground work in regarding the core feature flow. Will see what
  this looks like at our Monday session, but hopefully something either editor
  or instructor-state related.

### Bryan

#### Last Week's Goals

- Keep working on code editor (1-2 days)
- Load in preview code, start getting an idea of how synchronization from
  instructor's editor will be shown in learner's
- Explore screencast viewer options and start working on it (1 day)

#### What I Did

- Started writing some code to load in preview/starter code for problems
- Looked into options for how to go about video/screencast embedding
- Fixing up my computer troubles from last week
- Had already added things to the backlog

#### What Worked

- Reading up on video/screencast embedding for similar projects
- Set up my desktop environment again
- Working on my high fidelity prototypes on Figma

#### Where I Had Trouble

- Just putting in more time to working on the project due to midterms and
  getting sick

#### Where I Was Stuck

- Knowing what to do for high fidelity prototype since I missed out on the
  feedback session

#### What I Learned

- UI vision for the final project

#### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Write code for the code editor for the state synchronization tasks (3 days)
- Figure out how to do proper unit tests (1 day)
- Figure out how to work with the database and how it is currently set up (1
  day)
- Check in with team to cover me on what I have missed (1 day)

### Augusto

#### Last Week's Goals

- Keep up with the team work to not overwork anyone in the group because of me.
- Fix up work schedule so I can attend every class.
- Get ahead of the issues that are assigned to me in Github.

#### What I did

- Researched and learn more about env and how to use it correctly
- Code the env setu with lots of helps from Matthew
- Learned a lot about the structure of the project
- Refreshed the knowlodge about GitHub

#### What Worked

- Setting up env with the right variables
- Participate in the peer programming with Matthew and Ezzi where I learned about auth
- Studied the teammates parts in the project so I could understand and learn about it

#### What I had Trouble

- Understanding the structure of the project and how my part would work out

#### Where I was Stuck

- Setting up some variables for the env was a tough part
- The auth was a bit complicated but thanks to Matthew I could understand it

#### What I Learned

- How important is to keep the project organized
- Setting up env and auth

#### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Keep studying the code in GitHub to understand the project in a whole
- Participate in more peer programming to learn more complex stuff
- Keep up with the teams work
- Meet up with the team to understand the next steps
