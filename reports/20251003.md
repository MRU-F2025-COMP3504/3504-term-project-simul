- Began work on deciding software architecture
  - Frontend: Next.js + React + Tailwind + Zustand + Vercel hosting
  - Database: PostgreSQL with Neon using Drizzle ORM
  - Authentication: better auth
  - Extra discussions regarding Dockerized code running, Judge0, React based screencast player, and backend hosting
  - Started a sprint and allocated tasks
  - GitHub projects used to assign issues (code as well as deliverables)

#### What Worked
#### What Worked

- Development setup was smooth sailing
- Frontend, database, and authentication services finalized for architecture
- Using GitHub projects for task allocation

#### Where We Had Trouble

- Finding a timeslot for weekly meetings (before better solution was found)
- Working on improving P3 and P2 for review
- Working on the team/individual weekly report section

#### Where We Are Stuck

- Some tasks are blocked by others
  - Setup for better auth
  - Loading from database as it has nothing in it as of now

#### What We Learned

- Business logic for our project
- What to expect for CI/CD from now on
- How to test for future pull requests

#### Team Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Figure out UI after pooling ideas from lo fi prototypes (1 week)
- Build up frontend components for main UI (2 weeks)
- Populate DB with relevant data for the project (2 weeks)

## Individual Reporting

### Bryan

#### Last Week's Goals

- Start development on **code editor**

#### What I Did

- Started development
- Made **code editor component**
- Fixed up issues from **Assignment 3**
- Worked on **Assignment 4 (Testing and Bugs)**

#### What Worked

- Using **Monaco code editor**
- Getting project files up and running **locally**

#### Where I Had Trouble

- My desktop got **bricked** for unrelated reasons and that delayed some stuff for me
- **Scheduling**; but this has since been fixed as we found a better time slot

#### Where I Was Stuck

- Using shadcn-ui but there has since been a pull request in process of getting merged which sets it all up

#### What I Learned

- Better understanding of the teams vision for the project
- How meetings should be run from now on
- How code will be tested in our project

#### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Keep working on code editor (load in preview code, start getting an idea of how synchronization from instructor's editor will be shown in learner's) ( 1-2 days )
- Explore screencast viewer options and start working on it ( 1 day )

### Matthew

#### Last Week's Goals

- Start development üßë‚Äçüíª
- Begin work on our architecture
- Start a sprint and allocate tasks from the backlog

#### What I Did

- Started development üßë‚Äçüíª
  - Created a NextJS app
  - Configured ESLint and CI
  - Set up Husky for pre-commit hooks
  - Set up a GitHub action for creating weekly issues for these reports (waiting for merge)
- Completed my portions of Assignment 3 and submitted
- Started work on Assignment 4

#### What Worked

- We overall did a decent job at distributing our work via GitHub projects
- We were fairly productive at our non-class time meeting, managing to clarify some details around implementation and scope, and assigning some coding tasks.

#### Where I Had Trouble

- Communication was a bit tricky this week: I was sick Monday and heard radio silence from the group chat ‚Äì however a document I created was deleted, the assignment document doubled in size, and there were suddenly Git issues assigned to me. I eventually hopped on a call with a group member, but was left in the dark for a bit there.
- Scheduling is going to be a universal inconvenience. From people not wanting to commute to campus to people having changing work schedules, it's hard for us to book in regular meetings outside of class ‚Äì which are really needed.

#### Where I Was Stuck

- Still waiting on some of my groupmates' issues. Specifically, without authentication or a database, I'm pretty blocked on adding anything further, as it's hard to replicate our timeline functionality using only mocked data on the frontend, as it's the backend latency that's gonna hurt.

#### What I Learned

- Issues were assigned too leniently ‚Äì in the future, we need to establish timelines for our issues as a team, so that we collectively have deadlines to enforce. That way none of us are twiddling our thumbs waiting for a blocker.

#### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Define better timelines for everyone's tasks: we need a lot more structure regarding the actual execution of the project, and a team meeting where we hash out who's doing what by when is critical.
- I'd love to get some sort of code editor state integration working (if that's still assigned to me by the time we finish the above point)---

### Ezzidean

#### Last Week's Goals

- Set up a docker postgres for the project.

#### What I Did

- Completed all tickets related to the DB set up including packet and environment settings

#### What Worked

- Co-working on the issues I had initially setting up postgres as someone who had never used it before.

#### Where I Had Trouble

- Figuring out how to combine all of our different environments be it postgres, pnpm and drizzle to set up a working environment.

#### Where I Was Stuck

- Pretty much the same thing in terms of figuring out how to use all these different bits of software into our coding project.

#### What I Learned

- What the requirements for setting up a docker compose file are.
- Introduced to drizzle for the first time.
- Got much more familiar with setting up the basics of a larger project like this where usually I would be working in a pre-existing project.

#### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Completing relevant parts of the database tables (1-2 days)

### Augusto

#### Last Week's Goals

- Study to get more familiar with future requirements and tools that will be necessary in the project.
- Start to work on the part assigned to me.

#### What I Did

- Finally completed my part on the contract docs.
- Revise the requirements and git issues to see where I was falling behind (missed out the 2 classes in this week).

#### What Worked

- I didn't contribute this week, just some minor fixes on my own documentation.

#### Where I Had Trouble

- Organizing my schedule this week was a bit tough. Couldn't make up time to go to classes and ended up delaying some of my classmates' tasks.

#### Where I Was Stuck

- Understanding the structure and the scope of the project was challenging this week.

#### What I Learned

- Missing the monday‚Äôs meeting can be very harmful for my understanding.
- Organize work schedule properly can benefit my project performance.
- Ask for help wherever it‚Äôs necessary, as everyone in the group are very open to help.

#### Plans & Goals for Next Week

- Keep up with the team work to not overwork anyone in the group because of me.
- Fix up work schedule so I can attend every class.
- Get ahead of the issues that are assigned to me in Github.
